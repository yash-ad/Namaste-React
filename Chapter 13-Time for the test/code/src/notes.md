// ## Accordion Toggle Feature:-
```javascript

showTheIndex={() => {
  // Toggle the accordion state
  setShowIndex((prevIndex) => (prevIndex === index ? null : index));
}}

```
# 1.showTheIndex Prop:
showTheIndex is a prop that you pass to the RestaurantCategory component. It is a function that presumably handles the toggling of the accordion's visibility.

# 2.Arrow Function:
() => { ... }: This is an arrow function expression, a concise way to define a function. In this case, it's an anonymous function.

# 3.Toggle Accordion State:
setShowIndex: This is the state-setting function provided by the useState hook. It's used to update the showIndex state.
prevIndex: This is a parameter of the arrow function, representing the current state value of showIndex.
(prevIndex === index ? null : index): This expression determines the new state value for showIndex based on the current state (prevIndex) and the index of the accordion.

# 4.Explanation of the Expression:
(prevIndex === index ? null : index): This is a conditional (ternary) expression.
If the current accordion index (prevIndex) is equal to the index of the clicked accordion (index), it means the accordion is already open, so set the state to null (close the accordion).
If they are not equal, set the state to the index of the clicked accordion (open the accordion).

## Purpose:
The purpose of this code is to toggle the state of the accordion. If the accordion is closed, it opens it; if it's open, it closes it. This ensures that clicking on an accordion toggles its visibility.
