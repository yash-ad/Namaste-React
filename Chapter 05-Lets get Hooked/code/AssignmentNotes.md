# Namaste React ðŸš€

## Chapter - 5

### Lets get Hooked.


# 1.what is DOM?

DOM stands for Document Object Model. document as a tree of objects.the Document Object Model is a crucial concept in web development , The DOM represents each element in an HTML or XML document as an object.and these objects can be manipulated through scripting languages for example JavaScript to change and move the content of an HTML element.

# 2.What is the differenece between Named Export,default export and * as export?

So in javascript modules, you can use differernt export methods to make functions,objects,or values available for use in other modules,There are three common export methods are Named Export , Default Export , `* as`  Export.

>
* Named Exports allows you to export multiple values from a module.
  
* Default Exports allows you to export a single value as the default for a module.

* `* as` Exports allows you to import all exports from a module and use a namespaces to access them.


# 3.What is the importance of config.js file?

When using a `config.js` file , its essential to follow best practices for handling sensitive information,such as using environment variables for secret values and avoiding the inclusion of sensitive data and additionally documentation of configuration parameters is valuable for developers working on the project.


# 4.What are React Hooks?

React Hooks are functions that allow functional components in React to have state,lifecyle methods and side effects.
Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 to provide a more direct way to use state and other react features in functional components.

The most commonly udes React hooks are:-
 1.useState: Allows functional components to manage state. it returns an array with two elements or parameters,the current state value and a function that lets you update it.

 2.useEffect:Enables performing side effects in functional components.

 These hooks allow functional components to manage state and handle side effects.They make it easier to write code and maintain to it.


 # 5.Why do we need a useState Hook?

 The 'useState' hook is an essential for adding state management capabilities to function components in React, enabling them to handle dynamic data, user interactions and component re-rendering.it makes more powerful and versatile.


 # 6.Why React is faster?

 Because it can do faster DOM manipulations it can do effecient DOM manipulation,there is something known as Virtual-Dom there is something known as diff, reconciliation and React fiber.


 * React hooks which is known as states.

# 7.filter() method?

The filter method or a function is used to filter the value inside an array and it iterates over an array,and to create a new array from a given array consisting of only those elements from the given array which satisfy the condition.

* * Whenever a state variables updates , React will Re-renders the components.

* * React is only good at DOM operations / DOM manipulations.
